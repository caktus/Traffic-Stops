## Buttons

### CTA

This button uses colorSecondary, aka teal.
It may have an icon, which lives on the right side of the button.
They are a bit larger than other button types, as they're meant to grab
attention and direct users to the next step.

### Button, positive

Uses colorPrimary as field and border, text and icon are white.
It may have an icon, which appears on the left side.

### Button, neutral

Inverse of positive.
Uses white as field and colorPrimary as border, text, and icon color.
It may have an icon, which appears on the left side.

### Non-buttons

- This should probably be a distinct component from other button types (it doesn't share very much behavior)

In the designs, these appear to be simple links, but for accessibility and semantics
we're using button tags.
They may have icons, on either side of the text.
eg, "<- Back" button and "View all departments ->" button
