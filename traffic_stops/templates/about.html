        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>According to the US Department of Justice, vehicle stops are the number one reason for contact between citizens and police. NC CopWatch aims to provide a platform for North Carolina community members to have access to law enforcement stop, search, and use of force data. The site displays this data in graphs and charts and incorporates features that allow the user to compare the traffic stop data to population data, as well as review traffic stop data for individual departments over time. NC CopWatch was created to serve as a resource to community members, organizers, and advocates across the state of North Carolina seeking transparency and accountability in our statewide policing practices. The site should operate as an advocacy tool for those seeking policy changes in law enforcement practices.</p>
        <p>NC CopWatch presents data collected by the NC State Bureau of Investigation (NC SBI) related to all known traffic stops to have occurred in North Carolina since Jan 01, 2002. Data is available for most North Carolina law enforcement agencies and officers serving populations greater than 10,000. North Carolina law requires all such agencies to report their data on a monthly basis to the NC Department of Justice; however, some datasets are incomplete or remain unreported. Where data sets are incomplete or missing from the website it is because they have not been reported to the NC SBI. NC CopWatch does not have access to, nor does it publish, the names of officers, drivers, or passengers involved in traffic stops.</p>
        <p>NC CopWatch is a project of <a class="about-link" href="https://forwardjustice.org/">Forward Justice</a>.
